My hair is long and brown and a bit wavy, and I'm wearing a sleeveless sweater with brown and white stripes. In the background, there's this curly white thing going on that is part of my branding. It's kind of like a white swirl/loop in the background." class="headerillustration" src="styles/images/profileimage.jpg">

				<h3>Hi there!</h3>
				<p>
					My name is Marieke Hepkema, and I'm a 26-year old UX designer and illustrator, based in Amsterdam. Creativity is my passion and I love turning intricate problems into beautiful, clear, user-centered designs, supported by vibrant, bold illustrations.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe that digital interactive products can function as a tool to better people's lives, if designed ethically and with the needs of the end user in mind. Making a positive impact, even if that just means making a mundane product more joyful to use, is something that motivates me a lot.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've had a passion for drawing for as long as I can remember, and that passion turned into a love for digital design and illustration. I believe that implementing illustrations can strengthen your brand and the experience of your customers, and I would be happy to help you achieve that goal!
				</p>
				<p>I have experience working at agencies and I love a challenge. I am proficient in both the Dutch and English language and I like international settings, which is part of the reason that I moved to Amsterdam years ago. Please have a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marieke-hepkema-04324b158" target="blank">Linkedin profile</a> for a full summary of my work experience.</p>

				I have basic HTML & CSS skills, which is very useful in multidisciplinary settings (and for creating portfolios!).
				</p>
				<p>I completed my (Cum Laude) Bachelor's Degree in Communication and Multimedia Design in February of 2022. My <a href="thehappyjourney.html">graduation project</a> was graded with a 9/10 and <a href="https://www.hva.nl/kc-fdmci/gedeelde-content/nieuws/nieuwsberichten/2022/07/geslaagde-projecten-met-studenten.html" target="blank">won a Golden Dot Award for best student work</a>.</p>
				<p>I have completed a premaster and gained a (WO, fully English) Master's degree in Design Cultures at VU University Amsterdam in 2024.</p>
